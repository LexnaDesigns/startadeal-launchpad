    question: "Do I need a physical lot?",
    answer: "No. Many of our dealers start with online-only sales or operate from home. You can scale to a physical location when you're ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do this part-time?",
    answer: "Absolutely. While full-time commitment accelerates results, many dealers start part-time and transition once they're profitable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it legal in my province/state?",
    answer: "Yes. We help you navigate licensing requirements specific to your location. Our success rate for licensing approval is 98%.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with financing?",
    answer: "Yes. We connect you with financing partners and help you set up relationships with lenders for your customers.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I've never sold a car?",
    answer: "That's exactly who we built this for. Our system includes sales scripts, pricing strategies, and negotiation training. No experience required.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to get started?",
    answer: "Investment varies based on your location and business model. Book a discovery call and we'll create a custom plan with transparent pricingâ€”no hidden fees.",
